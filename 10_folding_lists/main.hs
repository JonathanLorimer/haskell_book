stops  = "pbtdkg"
vowels = "aeiouf"

nouns = ["bird", "dog", "kitten", "coffee", "girlfriend", "desk"]
verbs = ["walk", "attack", "eat", "study", "break"]

permutate a b = (,,) <$> a <*> b <*> a
-- a) Write a function that takes inputs from stops and vowels and makes 3-tuples of all possible stop-vowel-stop combina- tions. These will not all correspond to real words in English,although the stop-vowel-stop pattern is common enough that many of them will.
-- b) Modify that function so that it only returns the combina-tions that begin with a p.
-- c) Now set up lists of nouns and verbs (instead of stops and vowels) and modify the function to make tuples represent- ing possible noun-verb-noun sentences.
-- 2. What does the following mystery function do? What is its type? Try to get a good sense of what it does before you test it in the REPL to verify it.
-- seekritFunc x =
-- div (sum (map length (words x)))
--            (length (words x))
-- 3. Weâ€™d really like the answer to be more precise. Can you rewrite that using fractional division?
